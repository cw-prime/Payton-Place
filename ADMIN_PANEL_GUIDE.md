## ⭐ Review Moderation (New)

- Visitors can submit 1–5 star reviews directly from the Services page.
- New admin route: `/admin/reviews` lists all submissions with filters (status, rating, service, search).
- Actions available per review: approve, reject, feature/unfeature, edit details, and delete.
- Analytics card highlights pending count, average rating, and overall totals; also visible on the dashboard.
- Public API: `POST /api/reviews` (submit), `GET /api/reviews` (approved reviews for display).
- Admin API: `GET /api/reviews/admin`, `PATCH /api/reviews/:id/status`, `PATCH /api/reviews/:id`, `DELETE /api/reviews/:id`, `GET /api/reviews/analytics`.

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install New Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

###2. Update Environment Variables

Add to `backend/.env`:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
```

### 3. Create Admin User

```bash
cd backend
npm run create-admin
```

This creates:
- Email: `admin@paytonplace.com`
- Password: `admin123`

### 4. Test Authentication

**Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@paytonplace.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

You'll get a response with `token` - use this for authenticated requests.

**Create Project with Images:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -F "title=New Project" \
  -F "description=Project description" \
  -F "category=residential" \
  -F "type=Kitchen Renovation" \
  -F "images=@/path/to/image1.jpg" \
  -F "images=@/path/to/image2.jpg"
```

## 📱 Mobile Photo Upload

The backend is ready for mobile uploads! Admins can:

1. Take photos on their phone
2. Upload directly through the admin panel
3. Select Residential or Commercial category
4. Images are stored in `/uploads` directory

---

## 🔐 API Authentication

All protected endpoints require:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Protected Endpoints:
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project

### Public Endpoints (No auth needed):
- `GET /api/projects` - List projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get single project

## ❓ Need Help?

The core authentication and upload system is ready. To complete the admin panel, we need to create:

1. Project upload/edit forms
2. Project detail page (blog-style)
3. Route protection
4. Image preview/management

Would you like me to continue building these components?
